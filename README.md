# SchedulingAnimationTool
Our tool for monitoring the ships!

Scheduling animation tool designed to replace paper schedules and the subsequent need for extensive printing is an online 
application that can be accessed securely from any computer or tablet by multiple users worldwide. It provides a clear visual
representation of a vessel's location and planned activities and gives users an accurate insight into its future or ongoing 
operations.

By using scheduling animation tool, project teams can align their schedules and choose the most appropiate sequence of activities
minimising any loss of production time. The main benefit of using the tool is that it helps to eliminate any conflicts between
vessels by showing you where each vessels will be for the duration of the project and highlighting any issues. This tool is a
particularly useful resource for companies operating a large vessel fleet or planning a complex subsea project as it offers full
fleet management.
